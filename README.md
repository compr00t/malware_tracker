+++ Malware Tracker +++

This code is just a simple PHP and XML based script to keep track of some malware's C&C servers. Because I was not able to find any good template for a fast and easy tracker I descided to create one on my own and publish it.

+++ Add hosts +++

Just fill in your hosts in the ips.txt in the following format: "DATE; IP"
After that you can run the script worker.php which will collect all the needed informations and store everything in a XML. And in the end you can display that information with the a simple frontend in index.php.
