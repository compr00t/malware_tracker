Because I was not able to find any good template for a fast and easy tracker I descided to create one on my own and publish it.\r\n\r\n###Add hosts###\r\nJust fill in your hosts in the ips.txt in the following format: \"DATE; IP\"\r\nAfter that you can run the script worker.php which will collect all the needed informations and store everything in a XML. And in the end you can display that information with the a simple frontend in index.php.\r\n\r\n###Example###\r\nA live example can be found here for [Nymaim trojan](http://encodingit.ch/tracker/nymaim.php).\r\n\r\n###Licence###\r\nFree to use. Please keep licence notice at the bottom of the index.php.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
